# UpdateSequences

A mod that adds/updates sequences from my seq repository to your Sequenced Folder. It will check for updates every restart or via a command. You can enable or disable sequences of each difficulty without restarting the game.

commands :

!seq help
!seq fetch
!seq list
!seq enable/disable all
!seq enable/disable [DIFFICULTY]

[DIFFICULTY] = easy, normal, hard, harder, insane
